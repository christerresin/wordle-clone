          <h3>Frontend</h3>
          <p>
            The app/game is built with React. Based on a create-react-app
            boilerplate, building upon the shoulders of giants with hooks, props
            and callback functions for state management. Using functional
            components for simplicty and becasue the React community is leaning
            towards functional Components and not class based Components. The
            React frontend communicates with a API to start a configured game,
            make guesses and get result.
          </p>
          <p>
            While building the frontend React app i was using alot of state and
            useEffect. After getting the game up and running i started to
            refactor the frontend code, removing useEffects to avoid dirived
            state. While thinking over and redesigning state and the flow of
            information i started moving more of the logic to the backend.

          <h3>Backend/API</h3>
          <p>
            The backend is built with NodeJS using the framework Express to get
            a robust and fast server up. Using RESTful routing for both pages
            and API resources. A goal for the project was having the highscore
            page server-side rendered. I chose Embedded JavaScript (EJS)
            templating language to gengerate HTML with JavaScript for this.
          </p>
          <p>
            MongoDB is used to have presistent data for the highscores. An easy
            document style database. Connecting trou mongoose to MongoDBs cloud
            storage.
          </p>
          <p>
            When converting the backend to TypeScript a couldnt really get
            nodemon watching for dev script. Found and tested an alternative,
            "ts-node-dev". While completing the TS conversion of the backend i
            recon i killed all the backend tests. Modified package.json and get
            ts-jest up and running after some refactoring in the tests.
